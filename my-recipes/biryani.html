    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients. <img src="../images/biryani/step1.png"
                alt="Ingredients for biryani gathered on a table"></li>
        <li>Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large skillet. Fry potatoes in hot oil until lightly browned, about 3 to 5
            minutes. Remove to a paper towel-lined plate to drain; set aside. <img src="../images/biryani/step2.png"
                alt="Potatoes being fried in a skillet"></li>
        <li>Add remaining 2 tablespoons of oil to the skillet. Add onions, garlic, and fresh ginger; cook and stir until
            onion is soft and golden. Add tomatoes, salt, cumin, chili powder, pepper, and turmeric; cook, stirring
            constantly, for 5 minutes. <img src="../images/biryani/step3.png"
                alt="Onions, garlic, and spices being cooked in a skillet"></li>
        <li>Stir in yogurt, mint, ground cardamom, and cinnamon stick. Cover and cook over low heat, stirring
            occasionally, until tomatoes are cooked to a pulp. It may be necessary to add a little hot water if mixture
            becomes too dry and starts to stick to the pan. <img src="../images/biryani/step4.png"
                alt="Tomato mixture being cooked with yogurt and spices">
        </li>
        <li>Add chicken and stir well to coat. Cover and cook over very low heat until chicken is tender, 35 to 45
            minutes. There should only be a little very thick gravy left when chicken is finished cooking. If necessary
            cook uncovered for a few minutes to reduce the gravy. <img src="../images/biryani/step5.png"
                alt="Step5 image"></li>
        <li>Meanwhile, make the rice: Wash rice well and drain in a colander for at least 30 minutes. <img

        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet. Add onion; cook and stir until golden. Add cardamom pods, cloves, cinnamon
            stick, ground ginger, and saffron; stir in rice until coated with spices. <img
                src="../images/biryani/step7.png" alt="Rice being coated with spices in a skillet"></li>
        <li>Heat stock and salt in a medium pot until hot; pour over rice and stir well. <img
                src="../images/biryani/step8.png" alt="Hot stock being poured over spiced rice"></li>
        <li>Add chicken mixture and potatoes; stir gently to combine. Bring to a boil. <img
                src="../images/biryani/step9.png" alt="Chicken and potatoes being mixed with rice"></li>
        <li>Reduce heat to very low, cover with a tight-fitting lid, and steam for 20 minutes without lifting the lid or
            stirring. <img src="../images/biryani/step10.png" alt="Biryani steaming in a pot with the lid on"></li>
        <li>Spoon biryani onto a warm serving dish. <img src="../images/biryani/step11.png"
