    <h2>Description</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups basmati rice</li>
        <li>1 kg chicken, cut into pieces</li>
        <li>1 cup plain yogurt</li>
        <li>2 large onions, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>2 medium tomatoes, chopped</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons ginger-garlic paste</li>
        <li>1/2 cup fresh mint leaves, chopped</li>
        <li>1/2 cup fresh coriander leaves, chopped</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon red chili powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garam masala</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon saffron strands soaked in 1/4 cup warm milk</li>
        <li>4 green chilies, slit</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons ghee or oil</li>
        <li>4 cups water</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <li>Whole spices (4 cardamom pods, 4 cloves, 2-inch cinnamon stick, 2 bay leaves)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash the basmati rice thoroughly and soak it in water for 30 minutes. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>Marinate the chicken with yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, turmeric powder, red chili powder, garam masala, mint
            leaves, coriander leaves, and salt. Let it rest for at least 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Heat ghee or oil in a large skillet. Fry the sliced onions until golden brown and crispy. Remove half of the
            fried onions and set aside for garnishing.</li>
        <li>In the same skillet, add the marinated chicken and cook on medium heat until the chicken is partially cooked
            and the oil separates. Add chopped tomatoes and cook until they soften.</li>
        <li>In a large pot, bring 4 cups of water to a boil. Add salt and the whole spices (cardamom, cloves, cinnamon,
            bay leaves). Add the soaked rice and cook until it is 70% cooked. Drain the rice and set aside.</li>
        <li>In a heavy-bottomed pot, layer half of the partially cooked rice. Add the cooked chicken mixture on top,
            followed by the remaining rice.</li>
        <li>Drizzle the saffron milk over the top layer of rice. Add the reserved fried onions, mint leaves, and
            coriander leaves. Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid.</li>
        <li>Cook on low heat (dum) for 25-30 minutes, ensuring the steam does not escape. You can seal the lid with
            dough for an authentic dum cooking method.</li>
        <li>Once done, gently fluff the biryani with a fork, ensuring the layers remain intact. Serve hot with raita or
            salad.</li>
    </ol>
